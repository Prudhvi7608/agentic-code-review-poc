# PoC Requirements and Scope

## Agentic Code Review PoC


### Goals
- [x] Automate code review for files in GitHub repositories using an agentic workflow.
- [x] Provide actionable review comments, suggestions, and corrected code snippets.
- [x] Support review on pull requests and commits.
- [x] Post review results as comments on GitHub PRs using GitHub Actions.
- [x] Handle output parsing errors and ensure reliable, structured review output.
- [x] Allow real-time Q&A about any file in any repo via a Streamlit chatbot.
- [x] Chatbot should parse natural language to extract repo/file info and answer code questions.
- [x] Chatbot should respond conversationally to general queries, even if repo/file is not detected.
- [x] Use OpenAI LLM for review and chat responses.
- [x] Use GitHub PAT for full repo access.


### Additional Goals
- Support for non-Python languages (Java, etc.)
- Integration with CVS/x42
- Advanced multi-file or cross-repo analysis
- Full CI/CD integration beyond GitHub Actions

### Research Areas for CVS/x42 Integration
- Documentation or examples for x42 integration
- API or SDK for connecting agentic workflows to CVS/x42
- Authentication, data access, and workflow triggers in x42
- How to post review comments or automate actions in x42 (similar to GitHub Actions)
- Differences in file storage, versioning, or permissions compared to GitHub

### Success Criteria
- Agentic review workflow runs reliably on PRs/commits and posts actionable comments.
- Chatbot answers code questions for any repo/file and responds to general queries.
- All requirements above are met and demonstrated in the PoC.
